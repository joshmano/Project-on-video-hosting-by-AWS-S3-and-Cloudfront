# Project-on-video-hosting-by-AWS-S3-and-Cloudfront
## Overview:
This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) and CloudFront to host and deliver a sample video clip . By leveraging these AWS services together, we ensure efficient and secure delivery of video content while enhancing performance and user experience.

## Requirements:
- An AWS account
- Basic familiarity with AWS services (S3, CloudFront)
- Sample video file ()

## Steps:
1. **Create an S3 Bucket:**
   - Create a new S3 bucket to store the sample video file.

2. **Access Initial Issues:**
   - Attempt to access the sample video directly through its S3 object URL. Encounter restrictions due to the initial bucket policy.

3. **Set up CloudFront Distribution:**
   - Create a CloudFront distribution specifically for the video sample.
   - Configure essential options such as origin settings, caching behavior, and distribution settings.

4. **Update Bucket Policy:**
   - Update the bucket policy to allow seamless media streaming via CloudFront. Ensure proper permissions are set.

5. **Test Setup:**
   - Copy and paste the CloudFront distribution domain name and any required query parameters or object keys into a web browser.
   - Verify that the video plays without encountering previous permission-related obstacles.

6. **Finalize Configuration:**
   - Adjust CloudFront settings as necessary for optimal performance and security.
   - Ensure proper monitoring and logging are enabled for the CloudFront distribution.
